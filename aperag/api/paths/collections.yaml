      The file is streamed through the backend to support internal network deployments and maintain access control.
      
      **Document Lifecycle and Download Availability:**
      - UPLOADED: Downloadable (temporary status, auto-deleted after 24 hours if not confirmed)
      - PENDING/RUNNING/COMPLETE/FAILED: Downloadable (permanent, not auto-deleted)
      - EXPIRED: Not downloadable (file deleted by cleanup task)
      - DELETED: Not downloadable (soft-deleted by user)
      
      **Auto-Cleanup Mechanism:**
      A scheduled task runs every 10 minutes to clean up documents in UPLOADED status that are older than 24 hours.
      Once confirmed, documents will never be auto-deleted.

      Retrieve knowledge graph data. Two modes are supported:
      1. Overview mode (default): Uses the entire graph ("*") and intelligently selects the most important nodes
      2. Subgraph mode: When 'label' is provided, returns a subgraph centered on that node

      Node selection prioritization:
      1. For overview: nodes with highest degree (most connections), automatically removing isolated nodes
      2. For subgraph: nodes within specified hops from the starting node

      The overview mode is optimized for visualization performance by prioritizing well-connected nodes.

    description: |
      Merge multiple graph nodes into one, combining their descriptions, relationships, and vector data.

      Provide `entity_ids` array with 1+ entities and optional `target_entity_data` for customization.

      The operation:
      1. Auto-selects target entity (highest degree) if not specified in `target_entity_data`
      2. Combines descriptions using default merge strategy (concatenate)
      3. Merges metadata using default behavior: entity_type from target, others concatenated/joined
      4. Updates all relationships to point to the target node
      5. Updates vector storage data
      6. Removes the source nodes

      Entity type handling: Uses target entity's type if it exists, otherwise uses merged result.
      The operation is idempotent - if source nodes don't exist, it returns success.

      Analyze knowledge graph to identify potentially mergeable nodes using LLM for semantic similarity.
      Returns confidence-ranked merge suggestions for user review and decision.

      This is a stateless endpoint that analyzes the current graph and returns suggestions
      without persisting any state. Users can then use the suggestions with the existing
      merge_nodes endpoint to perform actual merges.

      The algorithm prioritizes high-degree nodes and uses LLM to judge semantic similarity
      based on entity names, types, and descriptions.

      3. Mark related suggestions involving the same entities as EXPIRED

      When rejecting, the system will:
      1. Update suggestion status to REJECTED
      2. No merge operation is performed

      The target entity data can be optionally overridden when accepting a suggestion.
