Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
Use {language} as output language.

---Steps---
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Full Name of the entity, must use **same language** as input text, it's important. If English, capitalized the name.
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.
Format the content-level key words as ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)

4. Return output in {language} as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. "If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us."

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

Stock markets faced a sharp downturn today as tech giants saw significant declines, with the Global Tech Index dropping by 3.4% in midday trading. Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.

Among the hardest hit, Nexon Technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.

Meanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.

Financial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.

Given a list of entities from a knowledge graph, identify groups of entities that should be merged because they refer to the EXACT SAME real-world object/individual/specific instance.

---Critical Rules---
1. ONLY merge entities that refer to the EXACT SAME specific real-world object/individual/instance
2. DO NOT merge entities that are merely related, similar, or belong to the same category/group/class
3. DO NOT perform conceptual abstraction or create abstract groupings
4. DO NOT merge distinct individuals who happen to have similar roles or belong to the same organization/group
5. Each entity must be a different name/expression for the IDENTICAL real-world object

---Steps---
1. Analyze each entity based on name, type, and description
2. Group ONLY entities that are different names/expressions for the EXACT SAME real-world object
3. For each merge group, determine the best target entity and provide merge reasoning
4. Only return groups that should be merged - do not return entities that should remain separate

---What TO Merge (Acceptable Cases)---
- Different names for the same company: "Apple Inc" ↔ "Apple"
- Full name vs abbreviation of same person: "John Smith" ↔ "J. Smith" 
- Different language names for same entity: "中国生态农业学报" ↔ "Chinese Journal of Eco-Agriculture"
- Former vs current name of same entity: "Tesla Motors" ↔ "Tesla Inc"
- Full name vs nickname/abbreviation: "New York City" ↔ "NYC"

---Confidence Score Guidelines---
Use these guidelines for confidence scoring:

**0.95-1.0: Perfect Match**
- Identical entities with only capitalization/formatting differences: "OpenAI" ↔ "openai", "iPhone" ↔ "iphone"
- Same entity with punctuation variations: "McDonald's" ↔ "McDonalds"

**0.9-0.94: Very High Confidence**
- Official name vs widely recognized abbreviation: "New York City" ↔ "NYC", "United States" ↔ "USA"
- Different language names for same entity: "Microsoft" ↔ "微软", "Apple" ↔ "苹果公司"

**0.8-0.89: High Confidence**
- Full name vs abbreviated form: "John Smith" ↔ "J. Smith", "Robert Johnson" ↔ "Bob Johnson"
- Formal vs informal name variations: "Apple Inc" ↔ "Apple", "Microsoft Corporation" ↔ "Microsoft"

**0.7-0.79: Moderate Confidence**
- Likely same entity but requires careful consideration
- Some ambiguity in descriptions or naming patterns

**Below 0.7: Low Confidence**
- Uncertain or potentially different entities
- Insufficient evidence for confident merging

---What NOT TO Merge (Prohibited Cases)---
- Different people with similar roles: "John Smith (CEO)" ≠ "Jane Smith (CEO)" (different individuals with same title)
- Members of same organization: "Apple" ≠ "Google" ≠ "Microsoft" (all are tech companies but distinct entities)
- Different locations in same region: "New York" ≠ "Boston" (both are US cities but different places)
- Related but separate events: "World War I" ≠ "World War II" (related conflicts but distinct events)
- Similar products from different companies: "iPhone" ≠ "Samsung Galaxy" (both are smartphones but different products)
- Related technologies: "Machine Learning" ≠ "Deep Learning" (related but distinct concepts)
- Different time periods: "2023" ≠ "2024" (consecutive years but different time periods)
- Sub-categories vs parent categories: "Smartphone" ≠ "Mobile Device" (specific vs general category)
- Companies and their subsidiaries: "Alphabet Inc" ≠ "Google LLC" (parent vs subsidiary)
- Different branches/departments: "Apple Marketing" ≠ "Apple Engineering" (different departments of same company)
- Sequential events in same process: "User Registration" ≠ "User Login" ≠ "User Logout" (different steps)
- Different versions of same product: "iPhone 14" ≠ "iPhone 15" (different product versions)
- **Parent entity vs specific service**: "Azure" ≠ "Azure OpenAI" (platform vs specific service)
- **Abstract concept vs implementation**: "Model Context Protocol" ≠ "MCP Server" (protocol vs server implementing it)
- **Company vs repository/project**: "LastMile AI" ≠ "lastmile-ai/mcp-agent" (company vs specific repository)

- **Different functional classes**: "OpenAISettings" ≠ "MCPSettings" (different configuration purposes)

---Output Format---
For each group of entities that should be merged, return:
("merge_group"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_names_list>{tuple_delimiter}<confidence_score>{tuple_delimiter}<merge_reason>{tuple_delimiter}<suggested_target_name>{tuple_delimiter}<suggested_target_type>)

Where:
- entity_names_list: List of entity names to be merged separated by {graph_field_sep} (e.g., "Entity A{graph_field_sep}Entity B{graph_field_sep}Entity C")
- confidence_score: Confidence level (0.0-1.0) for this merge suggestion. Use the confidence guidelines above.
- merge_reason: Brief explanation why these entities should be merged (must refer to EXACT SAME object)
- suggested_target_name: Recommended name for the merged entity
- suggested_target_type: Recommended type for the merged entity

Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter between merge groups.
When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
