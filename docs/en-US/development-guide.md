# 🛠️ Development Guide

[阅读中文文档](development-guide-zh.md)

This guide focuses on setting up a development environment and the development workflow for ApeRAG. This is designed for developers looking to contribute to ApeRAG or run it locally for development purposes.

## 🚀 Development Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up ApeRAG from source code for development:

### 1. 📂 Clone the Repository and Setup Environment

First, get the source code and configure environment variables:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apecloud/ApeRAG.git
cd ApeRAG
cp envs/env.template .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to configure your AI service settings if needed. The default settings work with the local database services started in the next step.

### 2. 📋 System Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your system has:

*   **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher is recommended for frontend development. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **Docker & Docker Compose**: Required for running database services locally. [Download Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

**Note**: Python 3.11 is required but will be automatically managed by `uv` in the next steps.

### 3. 🗄️ Start Database Services

Use Docker Compose to start the essential database services:

```bash
# Start core databases: PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, Elasticsearch
make compose-infra
```

This will start all required database services in the background. The default connection settings in your `.env` file are pre-configured to work with these services.

<details>
<summary><strong>Advanced Database Options</strong></summary>

```bash
# Use Neo4j instead of PostgreSQL for graph storage
make compose-infra WITH_NEO4J=1

# Add advanced document parsing service (DocRay)
make compose-infra WITH_DOCRAY=1

# Combine multiple options
make compose-infra WITH_NEO4J=1 WITH_DOCRAY=1

# GPU-accelerated document parsing (requires ~6GB VRAM)
make compose-infra WITH_DOCRAY=1 WITH_GPU=1
```

**Note**: DocRay provides enhanced document parsing for complex PDFs, tables, and formulas. CPU mode requires 4+ cores and 8GB+ RAM.

</details>

### 4. ⚙️ Setup Development Environment

Create Python virtual environment and setup development tools:

```bash
make dev
```

This command will:
*   Install `uv` if not already available
*   Create a Python 3.11 virtual environment (located in `.venv/`)
*   Install development tools (redocly, openapi-generator-cli, etc.)
*   Install pre-commit hooks for code quality
*   Install addlicense tool for license management

**Activate the virtual environment:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You'll know it's active when you see `(.venv)` in your terminal prompt.

### 5. 📦 Install Dependencies

Install all backend and frontend dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

This command will:
*   Install all Python backend dependencies from `pyproject.toml` into the virtual environment
*   Install frontend Node.js dependencies using `yarn`

### 6. 🔄 Apply Database Migrations

Setup the database schema:

```bash
make migrate
```

### 7. ▶️ Start Development Services

Now you can start the development services. Open separate terminal windows/tabs for each service:

**Terminal 1 - Backend API Server:**
```bash
make run-backend
```
This starts the FastAPI development server at `http://localhost:8000` with auto-reload on code changes.

**Terminal 2 - Celery Worker:**
```bash
make run-celery
```
This starts the Celery worker for processing asynchronous background tasks.

**Terminal 3 - Frontend (Optional):**
```bash
make run-frontend
```
This starts the frontend development server at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reload.

### 8. 🌐 Access ApeRAG

With the services running, you can access:
*   **Frontend UI**: http://localhost:3000 (if started)
*   **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
*   **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 9. ⏹️ Stopping Services

To stop the development environment:

**Stop Database Services:**
```bash
# Stop database services (data preserved)
make compose-down

# Stop services and remove all data volumes
make compose-down REMOVE_VOLUMES=1
```

**Stop Development Services:**
- Backend API Server: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `make run-backend`
- Celery Worker: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `make run-celery`  
- Frontend Server: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `make run-frontend`

**Data Management:**
- `make compose-down` - Stops services but preserves all data (PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, etc.)
- `make compose-down REMOVE_VOLUMES=1` - Stops services and **⚠️ permanently deletes all data**
- You can run `make compose-down REMOVE_VOLUMES=1` even after already running `make compose-down`

**Verify Data Removal:**
```bash
# Check if volumes still exist
docker volume ls | grep aperag

# Should return no results after REMOVE_VOLUMES=1
```

Now you have ApeRAG running locally from source code, ready for development! 🎉

   make compose-down
   ```

### Q: 🔄 How do I completely reset my development environment?

**Nuclear reset (destroys all data):**
```bash
make compose-down REMOVE_VOLUMES=1  # ⚠️ Stop services + delete ALL data
make clean                         # 🧹 Clean temporary files

# Restart fresh
make compose-infra                 # 🗄️ Fresh databases
make migrate                      # 🔄 Apply all migrations
make run-backend                  # 🚀 Start API server
make run-celery                   # ⚡ Start background workers
```

**Soft reset (preserve data):**
```bash
make compose-down                 # ⏹️ Stop services, keep data
make compose-infra               # 🗄️ Restart databases
make migrate                    # 🔄 Apply any new migrations
```

**Reset just Python environment:**
```bash
rm -rf .venv/                   # 🗑️ Remove virtual environment
make dev                       # ⚙️ Recreate everything
source .venv/bin/activate      # ✅ Reactivate
```
