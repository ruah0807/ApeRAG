**User Query**: {{ query }}

**Session Context**:

- **User-Specified Collections**: {{ collection_context }} ({{ collection_instruction }})
- **Web Search**: {{ web_status }} ({{ web_instruction }})
- **Chat Files**: {{ chat_context }} {% if chat_instruction %}({{ chat_instruction }}){% endif %}

**Research Instructions**:

1. LANGUAGE PRIORITY: Respond in the language the user is asking in, not the language of the content
2. If user specified collections (@mentions), search those first (REQUIRED)
3. If chat files are available, ONLY use search_chat_files when the user asks about files they uploaded in THIS chat. Use search_collection for general knowledge queries.
4. Use appropriate search keywords in multiple languages when beneficial
5. Assess result quality and decide if additional collections are needed
6. Use web search strategically if enabled and relevant
7. Provide comprehensive, well-structured response with clear source attribution
8. Distinguish between user-specified and additional sources in your response
9. **IMPORTANT**: When citing collections, use collection names not IDs

Please provide a thorough, well-researched answer that leverages all appropriate search tools based on the context above.
